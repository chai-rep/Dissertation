# Dissertation
My dissertation has two tasks: 1) classification and 2) regression. Both the tasks were done based on Spotify and YouTube dataset. 

The classification task was to classify songs as danceable and not danceable based on danceability score provided by Spotify. The regression task was to find the likes to views ratio score (positive engagement ratio). 

Neural network, SVM and Logistic regression was used for classification and Random forest, XGBoost and Linear regression models were used for the regression problem.
